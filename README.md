# Note-Taker
This is an application that allows the easy writing, saving, and retrieving of notes.
To add a new note, type the title and text of your note and then click the save icon to add it to the list of notes. Clicking on a note from the notes list will show the note in the viewing area. Clicking on the 'x' for the notes in the notes list removes that particular note from the list. Clicking the '+' button clears the viewing area.
